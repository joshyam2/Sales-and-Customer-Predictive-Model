# Sales-and-Customer-Predictive-Model
The objective of this project is to build a model to determine customer churn rate based on the given customer attributes. The metric to measure model performance that I will be using is AUC. With this in mind, the objective of the model is to achieve a high AUC between both the training and test data.
